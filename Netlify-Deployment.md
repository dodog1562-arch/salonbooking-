## Firebase Configuration for Production

Since your Firebase config is already set for production, it will work automatically on Netlify!

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Domain management
2. Add your custom domain (e.g., `assalon.com`)
3. Update DNS settings as instructed by Netlify

## Environment Variables (If Needed)

For production, you can add environment variables in Netlify:
- Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment
- Add any sensitive config if needed

## Test Everything

After deployment:
1. Test booking form
2. Check admin dashboard at `/admin`
3. Verify Firebase integration
4. Test on mobile devices

## Performance Tips

- Images are already optimized
- Consider lazy loading for more images
- Monitor Netlify analytics for performance

Your salon website will be live and ready to show clients!
