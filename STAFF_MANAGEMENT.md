- ❌ Removed: Balance from Staff interface
- ✅ Simplified to: Name + Contact only

### 2. **Added Delete Functionality**
- ✅ **Delete button** with trash icon
- ✅ **Confirmation dialog** before deletion
- ✅ **Real-time updates** after deletion
- ✅ **Firebase integration** for permanent deletion

### 3. **Enhanced UI/UX**
- ✅ **Search functionality** by name or phone
- ✅ **Placeholder text** in input fields
- ✅ **Empty state** message when no staff
- ✅ **Hover effects** on table rows

## 📱 **New Staff Interface**

### **Add Staff Form:**
- Name: [Input field]
- Contact: [Input field] 
- [Add Staff Button]

### **Staff Table:**
| Name | Contact | Actions |
|------|---------|---------|
| John Doe | +91 9876543210 | [🗑️ Delete] |
| Jane Smith | +91 9876543211 | [🗑️ Delete] |

### **Delete Process:**
1. Click trash icon → Confirmation dialog
2. Confirm "Yes" → Staff member deleted
3. Table updates automatically

## 🔍 **Features**

### **Search:**

### **Delete Confirmation:**
```
"Are you sure you want to remove John Doe from staff?"
[Cancel] [OK]
```

### **Empty State:**
```
No staff members added yet.
Click "Add Staff" to add your first team member.
```

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Add Staff:**
1. Go to Admin Panel → Staff tab
2. Click "Add Staff" button
3. Enter name and contact
4. Click "Add Staff"

### **Delete Staff:**

2. Click trash icon (🗑️)
3. Confirm deletion
4. Staff member removed

### **Search Staff:**

3. Search works for name and phone

## 📊 **Technical Changes**

### **Updated Interface:**
```typescript
// Before
interface Staff {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  contact: string;
  balance?: number;
  createdAt: any;
}

// After  
interface Staff {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  contact: string;
  createdAt: any;
}
```

### **Updated State:**
```typescript
// Before
const [newStaff, setNewStaff] = useState({ name: "", contact: "", balance: 0 });

// After
const [newStaff, setNewStaff] = useState({ name: "", contact: "" });
```

### **Added Delete Function:**
```typescript
const deleteStaff = async (staffId: string) => {
  try {
    await deleteDoc(doc(db, "staff", staffId));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error deleting staff:", error);
  }
};
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**
